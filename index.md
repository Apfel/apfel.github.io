##### [GitHub profile](https://github.com/Apfel)

### Projects
- **[DSiRC](https://github.com/Apfel/DSiRC)**           - Some simple yet quite broken IRC client I made for the Nitendo DSi.
- **[gotag](https://github.com/Apfel/gotag)**           - A **[JagTag](https://github.com/jagrosh/JagTag)** port for Go, for some sick text interpretation, done by a machine. Quite epic.

- **[openhmd-go](https://github.com/Apfel/openhmd-go)** - **[OpenHMD](https://github.com/OpenHMD/OpenHMD)** API bindings for Go, for all your gopher-ic Virtual Reality needs.
- **[xboxload](https://github.com/Apfel/xboxload)** - A wiiload clone for the Xbox, allowing easier testing of homebrew.
