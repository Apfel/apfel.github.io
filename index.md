Yeah, welcome to my GitHub webpage. I'm 15 years old and I make sort-of weird but `exciting` software for others to enjoy. I develop all sorts of stuff that interests me at the moment, examples being console homebrew, VR stuff, game development and other stuff like small libraries for various languages.

##### Here's my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/Apfel), which you can freely choose to follow or not.

### My projects
- **[c-cord](https://github.com/Apfel/c-cord)** - A C library for Discord bots.
- **[DSiRC](https://github.com/Apfel/DSiRC)**           - Some simple yet quite broken IRC client I made for the Nitendo DSi.
- **[gotag](https://github.com/Apfel/gotag)**           - A **[JagTag](https://github.com/jagrosh/JagTag)** port for Go, for some sick text interpretation, done by a machine. Quite epic.
- **[openhmd-go](https://github.com/Apfel/openhmd-go)** - **[OpenHMD](https://github.com/OpenHMD/OpenHMD)** API bindings for Go, for all your gopher-irc Virtual Reality needs.
- **[xboxload](https://github.com/Apfel/xboxload)** - A wiiload clone for the Xbox, allowing easier testing of homebrew. Check out **[nxdk](github.com/XboxDev/nxdk)** for homebrew development utilities.

In addition to that, here's a small demo of a WebAssembly module, written in Go, running on GitHub's Pages platform. <br>
It shows the current time ~~most likely in CEST~~.
