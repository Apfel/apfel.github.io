Yeah, welcome to my GitHub webpage. I'm 15 years old and I make sort-of weird but `exciting` software for others to enjoy. What I develop on is a potato with a high-powered accelerator that AMD calls Ryzen, but the platform the software itself ends up being on changes from time to time. I sincerely hope you'll enjoy the software I make.

Here's a quick little **uwu** for you all who've been scrolling far enough.

In addition to that, here's a small demo of a WebAssembly module, written in Go, running on GitHub's Pages platform. <br>
It shows the current time ~~most likely in CEST~~.
